            <p>I am Rakibul Islam.I have been studying in different subjects since 2012. I have been  switching from one job to another too since then. I had started my work life as a part-time waiter in a indian restaurent in Newcastle,UK in 2014 while I was studying Nautical Science in South Tyneside College. At that time i wanted to be a Navigator but soon after completing my study I gave up that career cause i didnot want to go to the sea leaving my parents alone, may be this one doesnot sound a very logical reason, but being very honest it is true. After that career switch I wanted to study a subject that will give me a good job easily after graduation. After some research I selected Civil Engineering, and then found a University that fulfills my requirements.I had to finance my study and living mostly by myself so I started looking for part time jobs but in Dhaka its not that easy and pays very low so I started giving tuition as a private tutor .I was good in Maths and Science so it was not a big deal for me and earnings were good enough for me to fulfill my needs.</p></div>
